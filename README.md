# Cell-Lapse
Open-source &amp; low-cost onstage incubator
This project deals with the design, development, and implementation of a low-cost onstage incubator (IO) using technologies such as 3D printing and Arduino.

This device, which already exists in the current market, is extremely useful when it comes to observing and analyzing cellular phenomena since it guarantees the appropriate
conditions for cell culture during its observation under a microscope. This is of vital importance to ensure that what is being visualized is in fact a natural cellular behavior, unaffected by stress symptoms. Without it, the visualization of the sample is only possible for short periods of time before damaging it.
However, the currently available models cost more than U$D 10,000. It is from this reality that the development axes of this proposal emerge: low cost and ease of implementation; the second refers to the open source approach of the work, aiming for the publication of all documentation (3D models, schematics and scripts) for free use. With the completion of the project, a space will be opened in the GitHub repository with such information and a user manual and a manufacturing manual will be provided.

For a better understanding of the work carried out, it was structured into four large groups: 3D models, electronics, control system and cell culture. It should be noted that many corrections and tests were carried out in parallel since all the components of the project are interconnected.
